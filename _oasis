Synopsis:

  Efficient bit streams for OCaml.

Description:

  Bitstream is a library for efficient handling of streams of bits. It
  handles various stream targets including big-arrays, endianess,
  aligment, efficient padding, buffering, non-blocking IO through Lwt
  or Async, buffer resizing, allows to choose between functional and
  imperative implementation, with or without exceptions, includes
  monadic interface, is functorised to allow customisations and is
  distributed as a single packed module that does not dependd on
  anything.
  .
  The library can be used to implement audio or video streaming,
  network protocols, JIT compiler, backend for binary parser,
  instruction decoder or encoder, compressor/decompressor, etc.
